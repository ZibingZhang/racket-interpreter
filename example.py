        #| Code written for an assignment at Northeastern.
        
        Some edits were made to fix formatting issues or to showcase additional features that were not used when 
        originally completing the assignment.
        - The 'list' function is used whenever possible, replacing nested 'cons' expressions.
        
        Some edits were made due to the fact that not all features of the language have been implemented. They will be
        reverted as those features are added.
        - The entire body of exercise 7 has been commented out since builtin procedures for strings have not yet been
          implemented.
        - The entire body of exercise 8 has been commented out as has the import statement for the image library.
        - The entire body of exercise 9 has been commented out. The number system is still a WIP... sqrt always returns
        - an inexact number which is never an integer.
        - All empty lists were originally represented with '() but now are represented with empty, even in data 
          definitions.
        - All templates have been commented out.

        ; The function add-up-all expects a PseudoLON. The program will break because at some point a Number
        ; will be passed to add-up-all, which is not a PseudoLON. A Number is neither a string nor a plist, so
        ; none of the conditions in the cond function will be met thus throwing an error.
        
        ; The reason this occurs is because each PseudoLON is either a String or a
        ; (make-plist Number PseudoLON). If we examine the given PseudoLON, we can clearly see it it not
        ; actually a PseudoLON. The nested "rst" part of the nested make-plist is 19 which is not a
        ; PseudoLON. At some point when (plist-rst plon) gets passed to add-up-all it will not be a PseudoLON
        ; thus throwing error as explained above.

        ; The program will break because the second argument in the cons function must be a list but is
        ; instead a number for the nested cons function. The compiler will throw an error. Let us assume
        ; though that it doesn't throw an error and somehow the argument (cons 17 (cons 18 19)) is passed
        ; to the function. add-lon takes in a LON, but at some point a Number will be passed to LON. A Number
        ; is neither an empty list nor a list which means that none of the conditional statements in the cond
        ; function will be met therefore throwing an error.
        
        ; The first reason why this will break is because the second argument passed to the cons function is
        ; not a list. Assuming that the complier ignores this error, another error will occur when add-lon
        ; is called on the rest of (cons 18 19). 19 is not a list so it will not return true for (empty? lon)
        ; or (cons? lon). It will not satisfy any case in the cons statement which will throw an error.
